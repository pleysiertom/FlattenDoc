# FlattenDoc Legacy Branch
A Flattening Tool for InDesign
Put simply, its an overengineered JPEG Exporter/Importer designed to give a brute force flatten solution to indesign

This is the legacy branch, which has all legacy versions.
Legacy Versions are handy for rolling back on older versions that may still work more effectively than the current up-to-date version
